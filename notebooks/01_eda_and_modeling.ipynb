    "## Task: Product Category Prediction from Title\n",
    "### ✍️Author: Sladjan Jeremic / SladjanJ\n",
    "In this project, a machine learning model is developed to automatically suggest the appropriate product category based on its title (e.g. \"Apple iPhone 7 32GB\" → \"Mobile Phones\"). The goal is to automate the product categorization process in an online store in order to reduce manual work, speed up the creation of new listings, and lower the risk of human error.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook will walk through all key steps of the project: loading and exploring a real‑world dataset with tens of thousands of products, preparing and cleaning the data, performing feature engineering (primarily on the Product Title field), transforming text using methods such as TF–IDF, training and comparing several classification models, evaluating them with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1‑score, and finally selecting and training the best model, which will later be saved and used in dedicated scripts for training and interactive category prediction."
